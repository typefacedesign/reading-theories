# Texts on Type

[Live Website: typefacedesign.github.io](https://typefacedesign.github.io)

This is a project for students and independent researchers in typeface design, offering a selection of dissertations, research papers, and other resources.

These resoures are curated.
The first criteria is that they were completed within established programmes of study.
Second, they should be both useful as references for their respective subjects, and also as examples of research writing in typeface design that can be considered more generally.

The aim is to support research and knowledge sharing within the wider typographic community.

The project was founded by Gerry Leonidas, with web development by John-Daniel Harrington, and supported by Dave Crossland and Google Fonts.
